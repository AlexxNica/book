# Prerequisites

This guide assumes you are already familiar with JavaScript and front-end development using React.

If you're not already familiar with other libraries of the React ecosystem such as React-Native, Redux and GraphQL/Relay, this guide can eventually serve as an introduction to them but it will focus on using them rather than going deeper into their purpose.

### Initial setup

Before starting to create the app, let's make sure you have the basic tooling needed, you will need:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [node](https://nodejs.org) v7+ \(older versions may work as well, but this guide is made using node 7\)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) \(not mandatory as you can also use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), packaged with node, but Yarn is faster and this guide will use it\)
* A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, to access GitHub's API and create an integration

All good? Great! Let's start by creating the project using React-Native!
