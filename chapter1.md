# Prerequisites

This guide assumes you are already familiar with JavaScript and front-end development using React.

If you are not already familiar with other libraries of the React ecosystem such as React-Native, Redux and GraphQL/Relay, this guide can eventually serve as an introduction to them but it will focus on using them rather than going deeper into their purpose.
